So I'm explaining all of the reasons for what I've decided over
[Octopress](http://octopress.org "Awesome Blogging Framework for Hackers")
insted of my almost desert [Posterous](http://rashpro.posterous.com).

One of the main things I want to maintain a blog is to share Code, 
either be Java, Ruby, Racket, C++, etc..., I have to be able to share
code almost seamlessly, in this [Octopress](http://octopress.org "Awesome")
excels all in all 


Let's say I have the following code:

	(define ackermann
		(lambda(m n)
			(cond
				[(zero? m) (add1 m)]
				[(and (> m 0) (zero? n)) (ackermann (sub1 m) 1)]
				[(and (> m 0) (> n 0)) (ackermman (sub1 m) (ackermann m (sub1 n)))])))
<!-- more -->

Even if it is enclosed on a box, it really looks awful but doing some magic here we get:

``` scheme Ackermann - ackerman.rkt
	(define ackermann
		(lambda(m n)
			(cond
				[(zero? m) (add1 m)]
				[(and (> m 0) (zero? n)) (ackermann (sub1 m) 1)]
				[(and (> m 0) (> n 0)) (ackermman (sub1 m) (ackermann m (sub1 n)))])))
```

looks totally diffrent doesn't it?, you can even embed sourcefiles, and it makes the code look superb

See, it took a gist over from [Github](https://github.com), and put it right here.

Now for the *Editing Part*, I've always liked [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs "The best text editor!")
and with some minor adjustments blogging from within *Emacs*, is as easy as pie
just with two major modes [Markdown Emacs Mode](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/) and this [Emacs-Octopress](https://gist.github.com/1760275), just changed

{% codeblock lang:scheme %}

--(let ((command-str (format "zsh -i -c 'cd %s && rake %s'" octopress-workdir command)))
++(let ((command-str (format "bash -i -c 'cd %s && rake %s'" octopress-workdir command)))

{% endcodeblock %}
 
 to match my bash shell.
 
 Well that should be just everything about now, stay tuned for more *awesomeness*, and more Random Ramblings.
