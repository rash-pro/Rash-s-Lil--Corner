So I've decided over [Octopress](http://octopress.org "Awesome blog for hackers")
 for my bloggin' needs, it just makes things work the way it is supossed to be, I'll be covering a lil' bit of info on the way I did the setup for my new blog, and how I'm managing the posting and stuff over my laptop.

So much for a hasty introduction, and of course stay tuned for the next update.

Ah and **BTW**
